Dictionaries

Dictionaries are provided as a convenience. NNSVS/ENUNU doesn't support multi-syllable words, which limits the usefulness of these dictionaries. For training you should ONLY use the blank.table file with a phonetic ust/score. The dictionary can be replaced after training.

Explaination of the dictionaries:

* blank.table - Standard phonetic table. For training and using voices phonetically rather than lexically.
* DVX_es-default_0.4.txt - Default Spanish dictionary, with full phoneme support.
* DVX_es-yeismo_0.4.txt - Same as default dictionary, with [ll] replaced with [y] due to yeismo.
* DVX_es-simplified_0.4.txt - Simplified dictitonary for datasets created with non-native speakers.
* DVX_es-simplified-yeismo_0.4.txt - Same as simplified dictionary, with [ll] replaced with [y] due to yeismo.
